# e-learning-forensics
Development of interactive version of the IAEA e-learning course on nuclear analytical techniques for forensic science
The course can be found in the IAEA CLP4NET learning platform https://elearning.iaea.org/m2/course/view.php?id=582 (IAEA NUCLEUS account is needed). 

2022-10-17: The course on line in CLP4NET is in this moment the non-interactive version.

The new version of the course is built in Articulate Rise, combined with animated and interactive elements created in Articulate Storyline.

A preview of the first module of the new course is available [here](https://IAEA-Physics-neutrons.github.io/e-learning-forensics)
